# scldata
An installable dataset (SCL2205) package for subcellular localisation prediction modelling.
It is suitable for clustering and classification machine learning, and contains dataset tracks for the *train-eval-test* and *cross-validation-test* (*k* = 5) model development approaches.
Preprocessing is already done, including homology reduction within and across corresponding splits.
